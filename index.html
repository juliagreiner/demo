  A paragraph is a group of words put together to form a group that is usually longer than a sentence. Paragraphs are often made up of several sentences. There are usually between three and eight sentences. Paragraphs can begin with an indentation (about five spaces), or by missing a line out, and then starting again. This makes it easier to see when one paragraph ends and another begins.
  </p>
  <p>
  In most organized forms of writing, such as essays, paragraphs contain a topic sentence . This topic sentence of the paragraph tells the reader what the paragraph will be about. Essays usually have multiple paragraphs that make claims to support a thesis statement, which is the central idea of the essay.
  </p>
  <p>
  Paragraphs may signal when the writer changes topics. Each paragraph may have a number of sentences, depending on the topic.
  </p>
  <p>
  A pilcrow mark (¶) is sometimes used to show where a paragraph begins.
